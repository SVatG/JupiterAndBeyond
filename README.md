# Jupiter & Beyond #

This is [SVatG](http://demogroup.vc/)'s entry in the wild compo at Revision 2013, another demo for the STM32F4DISCOVERY board, using a few resistors on GPIO pins to generate a VGA signal. It was programmed by [WAHa.06x36](https://bitbucket.org/WAHa_06x36/), [halcy](https://github.com/halcy), ryx and coda. It placed 5th.

**Be aware that this is demoscener code. View only at your own risk. Bleeding from the eyes may occur.**

fade

ADDITIONAL EFFECT COMPONENTS:
- point warping before bezier render

- something behind the font
- coming in from somehwere, flying out
(-) unsharpen


EFFECT IMPROVEMENTS:
- equal-speed bezier paths
- have the tails darken out, the heads in a special colour
- transition with more, randomly placed, intermediate points
- better matching between transition points

GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS:
- optimize bezier routine some more
- optimize pixel drawing routine

CODE IMPROVEMENTS:
- better build in demo-tree. include python in makefile, somehow include the code from fonttest.c

BUGS:
- missing pixel in transition line


PERHAPS LATER:
